    STRUCTURE OVERVIEW:
    ===================
        => "public" directory:
        ----------------------
        In this directory. There are 'css', 'js', 'images' folders and all the .css, .js (client-side) and images will be placed there
        respectively. They will be static files

        => "server" directory:
        ----------------------
        There must be a 'server.js' for controlling the requests and responses. Others can be 'schemas' folder for database schemas,
        or 'routers' for storing route files.

        => "views" folder:
        -------------------
        In this folder all the ".html" files will be placed but using the extension ".ejs" . This is same as html but can work with
        dynamic pages. So make sure you have EJS extension downloaded in VSCode.

            EJS Extension Information:
            --------------------------

    INSTRUCTIONS FOR FRONT-END DEVELOPER:
    =====================================
    => Keep all your .html files in the /views folder. But use ".ejs" instead of ".html". And I have mentiond how you will link external 
        css, js and image files in 'login.ejs' file.
    => Keep all your css, js and image files in /public/css, /public/js and /public/images folder
    => Keep the lines commented in the server.js where I have told you to do that for ensuing error-free running server
    
        RUNNING SERVER AND USING EJS FILES:
        ===================================
        => Go to the NoteRoom folder and open terminal there. then type 'npm install'. (There will be a /node_modules folder) 
        => Then keep the modules installed. After that
        => Type 'npm start' in the terminal (The server should be running)
        => To check if the server is running or not, go to the browser and enter this url: localhost:2000/login
        => Read the server.js for using routers and rendering ejs file (make sure the server is running)
   => This is another change
